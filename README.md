# SnowBlood
	SnowBlood is a sandbox project for self-learning. It would wrap up OS service, e.g. event scheduling, heap management etc., for customized needs. Eventually SnowBlood would become a middle layer between OS and Application. It would abstrat OS specific services and provide corresponding customized OS APIs for Application.
